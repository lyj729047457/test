# DRAFT in progress
The objective of the package module is to pack and export the binary release of aion rust kernel to allow a light and fast deployment.
The script of packaging can be found at the root of the project named **package.sh**. It can be used to:
* build the project (Release for now)
* pack the built release to an archive file
* create a docker image with the built release implemented

### Prerequisites
1. If you only want to deploy the package, skip this one. But if you need to pack the project, you will need all the prerequisites required to build the aion kernel. Please refer to [build-dependencies of aion kernel](https://github.com/aionnetworkp/aion_rust#build-dependencies).

2. Docker-ce

Docker-ce is the docker community edition which includes docker server/client as well as its command line tool. You will need it for both packaging and deploying. One way to install docker-ce on ubuntu 16.04 via APT is as follows:

First, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to the system:
```shell
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
```
Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:
```shell
$ apt-cache policy docker-ce
```
You should see output similar to the follows:
```shell
docker-ce:
  Installed: 18.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu
  Candidate: 18.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu
  Version table:
 *** 18.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu 500
        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     18.03.0~ce-0~ubuntu 500
        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages
......
......
```
Finaly, to install:
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
```
Check that docker is installed and the daemon is running:
```shell
$ sudo systemctl status docker
```
To run docker without root privileges, add your user account to the docker user group:
```shell
$ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```
To apply this change, you can log out the server and back in, or type the following to apply the change directly on you current terminal:
```shell
$ su - ${USER}
```
If you are packaging, you will need to download the ubuntu standard image to be used as a base image for your package. If you are deploying, skip this. To do so:
```shell
$ docker pull ubuntu
```

### Packaging
To build and package aion rust kernel, go to the root of the project and run the script **package.sh**.
You can check the available options by typing:
```shell
$ ./package.sh -h
```
To pack the release as archive file named **package.tar.gz**, type:
```shell
$ ./package.sh -p
```
To pack the release as docker image named **package_docker_ubuntu.tar.gz**, type:
```shell
$ ./package.sh -d
```
Either way, the script will try to build the project (Release only for now) if not yet built.
The packed files are available in the **export** repository (will be created if not yet exist) under the root of the project.

### Deploying
To deploy the docker package (on ubuntu 16.04 only), first make sure that you have followed the docker installation part in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). Note that the following example commands use **aion** as the name for both image and container. If you prefer other names, replace those names in the command as you like.

Get to your docker package and type the following to load it to your system images:
```shell
$ docker load -i package_docker_ubuntu.tar.gz
```
You can check the loaded image by typing:
```shell
$ docker images
```
You should see a newly created image named aion.
Then create and run a new container based on this image:
```shell
$ docker run -dit --name aion aion
```
The option **d** runs the container in background and the options **i** and **t** make sure that the container remains active after being created.
You can check created containers by typing:
```shell
$ docker ps -a
```
You are encouraged to create and run multiple containers based on the package image to have multiple running instances if you need.

Now, to run aion rust kernel in the created container:
```shell
$ docker exec aion home/parity
```
If everything goes well, you should see runtime logs of the aion kernel being printed on your terminal.
#### Optional
1.To go into the docker container for check or manual manipulation:
```shell
$ docker attach aion
```
To exit from a docker command line, if you use **ctrl-d** or **exit**, the container will be shut down; if you use **ctrl-q**, the container will be left running.

2.To stop a container:
```shell
$ docker container stop aion
```
3.To restart a container:
```shell
$ docker container restart aion
```
4.To remove a container
```shell
$ docker rm aion
```
5.To remove an image:
```shell
$ docker rmi aion
```
